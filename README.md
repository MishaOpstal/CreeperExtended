# Creeper Extended  

**Creeper Extended** takes Minecraft’s already-chaotic creepers and cranks the dial up past eleven. Expect flashbangs, stun potions, custom effects, music discs, and creepers that beep and spin like they’re auditioning for an action movie. This is an early version of the mod — features are still being added, and feedback is welcome on GitHub.

  - Configurable radius, fade timing, color, and sound.  
  - Optional: creepers can also flashbang when they blow up, because why not.  

- **New Status Effects**  
  - Flashbang effect — exactly what it says on the tin.  
  - Stun effect — brewable with water + flashbang. Comes with potion support for creative combat tricks.

- **Creeper Rework**  
  Creepers don’t just hiss and pop anymore:  
  - They spin like a top and beep like a countdown timer.  
  - Beeping gets faster until detonation.  
  - Every part of this behavior can be tweaked in the config.

- Spin animation and particle toggle.  
- Flashbang visuals (color, fade timing) and volume.  
- Beep frequency and escalation.
